"Simple spring boot image CRUD Demo" 

To use this template
1. Clone or save to desktop
2. Open in your favourite editor (i used eclpse for this)
3. Clean and run the project 

NB:
the UserController can be updated as required to handle
1. update()
2. edit()
3. delete()

Perhaps sooner or later i'll lazily add that implimentation
